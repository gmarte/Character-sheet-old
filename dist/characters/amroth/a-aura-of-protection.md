#### **Aura of Protection** (Su)

At 8th level, you can emit a 30-foot aura of protection for a number of rounds per day equal to your cleric level.
You and your allies within this aura gain a +{{1 + Math.floor((c.info.levels.priest-8)/4)}} deflection bonus to AC and resistance {{c.info.levels.priest >= 14 ? 10 : 5}} against all elements (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic).
These rounds do not need to be consecutive.
