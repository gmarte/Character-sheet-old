#### **Energy Absorption** (Su)

You gain {{3 * c.info.levels.wizard}} energy absorption per day.
Whenever you take energy damage, apply immunity, vulnerability (if any), and resistance first and apply the rest to this absorption, reducing your daily total by that amount.
Any damage in excess of your absorption is applied to you normally.
