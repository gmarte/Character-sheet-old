#### **Immunity to Magic** (Ex)

A stone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell resistance. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below.

* A *[transmute rock to mud]* spell slows a stone golem (as the slow spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw, while *[transmute mud to rock]* heals all of its lost hit points.
* A *[stone to flesh]* spell does not actually change the golem's structure but negates its damage reduction and immunity to magic for 1 full round.
