#### **Slow** (Su)

A stone golem can use a *[slow]* effect, as the spell, as a free action once every 2 rounds.
The effect has a range of 10 feet in a burst centered on the golem and a duration of 7 rounds, requiring a DC {{ 10 + Math.floor(c.info.levels.hd/2) + c.stats.scores.con.modifier() }} Will save to negate.
